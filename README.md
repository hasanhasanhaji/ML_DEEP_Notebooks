### Machine and Deep Learning Notebooks Repository

This repository serves as my personal collection of implemented machine learning and deep learning algorithms, developed primarily in Google Colab. This project is a living portfolio showcasing my practical skills and understanding of core concepts in the field.

### About This Project

The goal of this repository is to systematically implement, document, and share a wide range of ML and DL algorithms. Each notebook represents a hands-on project, from foundational concepts like linear regression to advanced topics in neural networks and computer vision.

This collection is a key part of my journey in data science and is designed to serve as both a personal reference and a public portfolio for demonstrating my technical abilities.

### Repository Contents

You will find notebooks covering a variety of topics, including:

* **Supervised Learning**: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
* **Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and other dimensionality reduction techniques.
* **Deep Learning & Neural Networks**: Implementing various architectures such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Projects involving text classification and sentiment analysis.
* **Data Preprocessing and Visualization**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning notebooks.

### The Workflow: From Colab to GitHub

All notebooks in this repository are developed in Google Colab. My workflow involves seamlessly connecting Colab to this GitHub repository. This allows me to:

1.  **Develop** and experiment in a cloud-based environment without a local setup.
2.  **Commit** and save changes directly to this repository, ensuring all my work is version-controlled.
3.  **Maintain** a clear and organized history of my progress and code implementations.

This process ensures that every notebook you see here is up-to-date and directly linked to my development environment.

### How to View the Notebooks

You can view the notebooks directly on GitHub. For an interactive experience, click on any `.ipynb` file to open it in Google Colab (via the "Open in Colab" button) or a notebook viewer.
